# Habit Centred Todolist

Habit Centred Todolist is a productivity app that combines the power of a traditional todolist with habit tracking and habit inference. The app helps you not only manage your daily tasks, but also build and maintain habits that support your goals and address your pain points.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete tasks with time constraints and durations.
- **Habit Tracking**: Create your own habits, set schedules, and track your progress and streaks.
- **Habit Inference**: Describe your goals or pain points, and let the app infer relevant habits using AI.
- **Integrated Scheduling**: Automatically checks for time clashes between tasks and habits, and suggests an optimized daily routine.
- **Sleep Schedule**: Set your sleep and wake times to ensure your schedule fits your lifestyle.
- **Progress Visualization**: See which habits and tasks are completed, and monitor your habit streaks.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works

1. **Add Tasks**: Enter your tasks with optional start time, end time, and duration. The app prevents overlapping tasks.
2. **Infer Habits**: Use the "Infer" section to describe your goals or pain points. The app uses AI to suggest habits that can help you achieve your goals or overcome challenges.
3. **Create Habits**: Manually create habits, set their duration, interval, and schedule them on specific days.
4. **Edit Habits**: Adjust habit schedules and settings as your routine evolves.
5. **Schedule Optimization**: The app combines your tasks and habits, checks for time clashes, and generates a recommended routine.
6. **Track Progress**: Mark tasks and habits as completed, and build streaks for your habits.
